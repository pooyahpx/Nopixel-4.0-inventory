# help for installation:

1. download resource
2. drag and drop in your server source
3. rename it to qb-inventory
4. if you use other inventory change all to qb-inventory ( like ps-inventory to qb-inventory ) .

# POV
if ur last inventory was another inventory you should open ur all resourcs folder in vs code and export all lj-inventory or ps-inventory TO qb-inventory
